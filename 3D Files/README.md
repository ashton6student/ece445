# 3D Files

## Project Overview

This folder contains a collection of 3D model files for various components for the VR glove project. The files are organized into subfolders based on their functionality or component type. These models are primarily intended for 3D printing and prototyping.

### Subfolder Descriptions

- **ReelCoin/**: Contains STL files for different versions of a circular reel coin component.
- **FingerTip/**: Various iterations of the fingertip component.
- **HapticsSystem/**: 3D models for the haptic feedback system, containing several versioned files.
- **BreadboardMount/**: Models for mounting the PCB, battery, and related electronics.
- **ReelGuide/**: STL files for guiding or housing reels, with multiple versions available.
- **GloveMount/**: Mounting components for a glove-based setup, with multiple iterations.
- **Z.Misc/**: Miscellaneous components, including custom reels, gear models, and a pot holder.

## Usage

1. Inspect the STL files using 3D modeling software (e.g., Blender, Fusion 360) to verify dimensions.
2. Print using a 3D printer with compatible filament (e.g., PLA, ABS).
3. Adjust the model scale and orientation as needed before slicing.
